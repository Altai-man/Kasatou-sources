    A registration backend which follows an invitation workflow:

    1. User request an invitation
    
    2. User signs up, account is created and activated since the 
       user already introduces invitation code.    
    
    3. USer is authenticated    

    Using this backend requires that

    * ``registration`` be listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
      (since this backend makes use of models defined in this
      application).

    * The setting ``INVITATION_CODE_DAYS`` be supplied, specifying
      (as an integer) the number of days from receiving the invitation
       during which a user may activate their account (after that period
      expires, activation will be disallowed).

    Additionally, registration can be temporarily closed by adding the
    setting ``REGISTRATION_OPEN`` and setting it to
    ``False``. Omitting this setting, or setting it to ``True``, will
    be interpreted as meaning that registration is currently open and
    permitted.
